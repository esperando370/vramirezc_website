### About me

My main research interest is understanding the evolution of traits generated by interactions between organisms, especially by the predator-prey interactions, mostly in amphibians and reptiles. I am also interested in the evolution of toxicity resistance and the genetic basis of neurotoxin resistance. On the other hand, I like to contribute to science communication in Spanish and diversity in STEM.

I work with an excellent group of scientists lead by Rebecca Tarvin. For more information go to [Tarvin lab](https://www.tarvinlab.org/).
