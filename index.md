### About me

My main research interest is understanding the evolution of traits generated by interactions between organisms, especially by the predator-prey interactions, mostly in amphibians and reptiles. I am also interested in the evolution of toxicity resistance and the genetic basis of neurotoxin resistance. On the other hand, I like to contribute to science communication in Spanish and diversity in STEM.

I work with an excellent group of scientists lead by Rebecca Tarvin. For more information go to [Tarvin lab](https://www.tarvinlab.org/).

### Active research interests

- Adaptations to new environments or novel interactions among organisms increases biological diversity. One type of interaction that often drives biological diversification is predator-prey interactions, which could result in co-evolution between different organisms adjacent in a food web. For my PhD, I am working with snake predators of poison frogs in Colombia to evaluate how multiple predators have adapted to feeding on a cocktail of toxins (poison frogs secrete multiple alkaloids).

- For non-English native speakers, English proficiency influences the individual "success" of a researcher, this creates a constant pressure to learn and improve English. Also, there is a strong correlation between English proficiency and technological innovation, these trends likely generate a global gap in scientific productivity and use of scientific knowledge in countries with low English proficiency. A main goal for me as a scientist is to understand and generate alternatives to the effects of the hegemony of English.
